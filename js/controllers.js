We will demonstrate that it works by comparing the DNA of humans and strawberries.  We will describe the principles behind DNA and how gel electrophoresis can be used to visualize it. We intend to increase public awareness of DNA concepts and dispel common misconceptions about the field of biotechnology.\r\n\r\nMuch of modern science requires years of training and expensive equipment to create experiments and analyze natural phenomena, but a great deal can be done by the common layperson with materials that are comparatively cheap and easy to acquire. Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Science breathes new life into a discipline by providing broader opportunities for people to engage with a body of material and find common practical value in previously esoteric ideas.\r\n\r\nThis project will be a DIY reproduction of a common laboratory technique called gel electrophoresis. This technique involves cutting up a DNA molecule with enzymes, applying a tracking dye, and using electrodes to run the negatively-charged DNA through a gel with pores of various sizes, resulting in a gel with bands at different locations, corresponding to the different sizes of the fragments. The smaller the fragment, the farther it will travel through the gel. This will demonstrate that DNA is unique to that organism and that their genetic profiles can be compared and differentiated visually. In this experiment, the bands seen from the human DNA will differ from those of the strawberry DNA. This will teach the observers the basics of working with DNA and one of the many ways that it can be manipulated. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to presenting our project at the Maker Faire to share our DIY DNA gel electrophoresis box and show the public the difference between human and strawberry DNA.", "web_site": "synbioatucf.blogspot.com", "promo_url": "http://www.callformakers.org/orlando2013/default/promo.json/70", "qrcode_url": "/orlando2013/static/images.json/qrcodes/qrcode-70.png", "project_short_summary": "We will build a DNA gel electrophoresis chamber from common materials and demonstrate the visualization of DNA and the differences in human and strawberry genetics.", "location": "Level 3 - Rotunda", "video_link": "", "organization": "Synthetic Biology Club at UCF", "photo_link": ""}, {"category": "Sustainability", "project_name": "The Creation Station", "description": "Kaiden Davidson (age 8) and Tairen Davidson (age 6) are homeschooled aspiring homesteaders who would like to share their \"expertise\" in the area of organic gardening, up-cycling and the exciting world of DIY projects.

These moments are also when quinceaneras and the bridal party want to look and feel their best, but, often, the access to their articles within their handbags is impractical or impossible.

It is a \u201cWilly Wonka meets Rube Goldberg\u201d show stopper. This hand crafted machine gets the attention of kids and adults alike.\r\nHow it works: The individual first loads their cup on to the conveyor. They then lower the ice grinder via a rope attached to some rings. They then add ice by pulling on a belt attached to a pulley. They then advance the cup under the ice grinder by cranking a handle attached to the conveyor. Next, they sound a train horn to announce that the wheel is about to get started. They then run or walk in the wheel to grind their ice. When the cup is full, they advance their cup via conveyor further down the line. Here, the student pulls a lever to activate a large plastic hand that smashes the crushed ice into the cup. They then exit the wheel and move the cup to the next operation on the conveyor belt.  At this location, they apply the flavorings to their ice by activating the shower heads, which pours the pressurized flavorings on to the ice. Tons of fun! \r\n\r\n The whole attraction is the means by which the kids get involved creating their masterpiece. They become the \"Maker\". The snow cone that they create is just a small part of the big picture (sort of a reward for their participation). This booth gets kids involved in the arts. It\u2019s main drive is to get kids to be creative, and to think beyond what is considered the norm; to be artistic. This is truly one of a kind!

Bat houses provide shelter for local bat populations, and those little insectivores help us humans in turn by devouring insect pests. Bat houses are a green way to help both the bats and ourselves in a \"win-win\" deal.\r\n\r\nThe college bat house is truly a \"smart home\" for bats, since it is fitted with entrance and exit sensors, as well as sensors for temperature and light, all of which feed an Arduino-based data acquisition and logging system.\r\n\r\nIn building the campus bat house, students and faculty in multiple programs at Valencia are learning about technology and biology in a sustainable, real-world application.  Building Construction students under Professor Andy Ray designed and built the structure.  Computer Programming and Electrical Engineering Technology students attached sensors and wrote software to collect data about bat occupancy and environment.  Biology students will use the campus bat house as a living laboratory, using the data from the sensors and their own observations to study bat behavior. \r\n\r\nThis exhibit will provide a unique opportunity for children and adults to learn just what sort of home bats actually like, and to better understand both bats and technology.", "web_site": "", "promo_url": "http://www.callformakers.org/orlando2013/default/promo.json/124", "qrcode_url": "/orlando2013/static/images.json/qrcodes/qrcode-124.png", "project_short_summary": "Look at and learn about Valencia College's high-tech bat house, currently under construction.

With a hard coating on the foam we are able to make a set of fiberglass molds.  With the fiberglass molds we are able to make a body shell inside of the molds.   Once I have this unique shape in the fiberglass shell form I am able to build up a drivetrain under the fancy skin.
